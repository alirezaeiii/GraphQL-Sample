# GraphQL Sample
A sample which showcases Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, Hilt and [Apollo GraphQL](https://studio.apollographql.com/public/countries/) inspired by [Philipp Lackner](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DME3LH2bib3g&ved=2ahUKEwjw-5zK_IeLAxWrGDQIHfSyNy0QwqsBegQICxAF&usg=AOvVaw25hDoSBPjO19O_dbNVqfoW)

## Prerequisites

You need to run this task to generate schema in the project :
```
./gradlew :app:downloadApolloSchema --endpoint=https://countries.trevorblades.com/graphql --schema=app/src/main/graphql/com/example/schema.graphqls
```

## Libraries
* [Android Jetpack](https://developer.android.com/jetpack)
   * [Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose) Androidâ€™s modern toolkit for building native UI.
   * [ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel) is designed to store and manage UI-related data in a lifecycle conscious way. This allows data to survive configuration changes such as screen rotations.
   * [Hilt](https://developer.android.com/training/dependency-injection/hilt-android) is a dependency injection library for Android that reduces the boilerplate of doing manual dependency injection in your project.
* [Apollo GraphQL](https://github.com/apollographql) is a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with your existing data.
